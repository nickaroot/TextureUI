# TextureUI

Texture (AsyncDisplayKit) DSL Support with lazy node introspection

### TextureSwiftSupport replacement

Old versions of TextureSwiftSupport requires some strange analytics dependencies
That's why I prefer to implement DSL based on [OpenSwiftUI](https://github.com/Cosmo/OpenSwiftUI) technics
One more improvement â€” Lazy node introspection, we need it to provide LayoutElement to Texture

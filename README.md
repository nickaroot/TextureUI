# TextureUI

Texture (AsyncDisplayKit) DSL Support with lazy node introspection

### TextureSwiftSupport replacement

Old versions of TextureSwiftSupport requires some strange analytics dependencies<br />
That's why I prefer to implement Texture DSL based on [OpenSwiftUI](https://github.com/Cosmo/OpenSwiftUI) technics<br />
One more improvement — Lazy node introspection, we need it to provide LayoutElement to Texture
